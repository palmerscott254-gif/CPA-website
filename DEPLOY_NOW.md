## 🔧 If Something Goes Wrong

### Issue: Pages still blank
**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check backend is running: `https://cpa-website-lvup.onrender.com/api/subjects/`

### Issue: Console shows CORS errors
**Solution**:
- Backend CORS is already configured
- May need to wait for backend to "wake up" (30 seconds)
- Refresh page after 30 seconds

### Issue: "Network Error"
**Solution**:
- Check internet connection
- Verify backend URL in Render dashboard
- Ensure both frontend and backend are deployed
